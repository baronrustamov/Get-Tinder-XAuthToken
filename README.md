# Get Tinder XAuthToken

## Usage
**NOTE**: You need to have registered your Facebook account with Tinder first to use this.

The script will ask you your Facebook email and password, and it will retrieve a Tinder XAuthToken automatically using automated browser (Google Chrome). You probably already have Google Chrome on your computer but if not, you need to install it. 

## Motivation
I started working on TinderImageDownloader in 2018, but I realized it is quite the pain to get a access token and needed something that would work for me but have been slacking off. However, I've finally decided to do it two years later for the reasons which shall remain secret.

## Dependencies
You need to have a few python packages. I believe all of them can be downloaded via pip. Specifically, you will need: 

- [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)
- [ChromeDrive - WebDriver for Chrome](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
- [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)
- [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
