# Get Tinder XAuthToken

## Usage
**NOTE**: You need to have registered your Facebook account with Tinder first to use this.

The script will ask you your Facebook email and password retrieves a Tinder XAuthToken automatically using the automated browser (Google Chrome via Selenium). You probably already have Google Chrome on your computer but if not, you will need to install it. 

## Motivation
I started working on TinderImageDownloader in 2018, but I realized it is quite the pain to get the access token and needed something that would work for me. I had been slacking off, but I finally decided to do it two years later for the reasons that shall remain secret.

## Dependencies
You need to have a few python packages. I believe all of them can be downloaded via pip. Specifically, you will need: 

- [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/)
- [ChromeDrive - WebDriver for Chrome](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
- [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)
- [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
